Using SQL:

-Phase A: At first ,I created the base by reaching its efficient form(3NF) and I made the tables.

-Phase B: I inserted data into the database and I executed five queries. Then I made indexes in order to speed up the performance of the last two queries. 
After that, I compared the performances of these queries with and without indexes.
